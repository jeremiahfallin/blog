is a tool to use in conjunction with Spotify. Discover Weekly and
Release Radar are two playlists that Spotify creates for a user to
discover new music. The music in these playlists is cycled out
every week and there is no way to find a previous week's songs if
you didn't store them anywhere. I always add these songs to one
playlist which became much too large. This tool lets you select a
playlist and when you're playing songs in that playlist you can
either approve a song and have it added to another playlist or you
can skip the song which will delete it. Useful for cutting down
large playlists. Styling is not completed but app is functional.
