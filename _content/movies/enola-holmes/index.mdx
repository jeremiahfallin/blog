I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid I would tell my mom that I wanted to be a detective when I grew up because I was a big fan of Sherlock Holmes as a character and I also liked watching [Detective Conan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/235/Detective_Conan).

Spoilers from the BBC Sherlock Holmes series below.

In the books another Holmes sibling is never really talked about. This has not stopped the BBC Sherlock series or author Nancy Springer from creating a third Holmes sibling.
