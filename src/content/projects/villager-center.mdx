is a tool for narrowing down the 391 villagers in Animal Crossing:
New Horizons down to 10 (the number that will fit on a player's
island). It's hard to pick favorites and this tool was made to
help. Uses React with a custom hook I wrote, useFavorite, that
keeps track of what villagers have been picked over other
villagers to come up with a top 10. Custom useFavorite hook is
generic and could be used for other favorite finding websites
written in React.
